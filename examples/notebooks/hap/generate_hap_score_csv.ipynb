    "### Overview\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of the HAP transformation to annotate documents with a `hap_score`, \n",
    "indicating the likelihood of Hate, Abuse, or Profanity in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "The HAP process consists of:\n",
    "1. **Sentence Splitting**: Documents are split into sentences using NLTK.\n",
    "2. **HAP Annotation**: Each sentence is scored between 0 and 1 (1 = high HAP, 0 = no HAP).\n",
    "3. **Aggregation**: The document's final HAP score is the maximum score among all sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration\n",
    "- **Model Name**: IBM Granite Guardian (`ibm-granite/granite-guardian-hap-38m` by default).\n",
    "- **Document Text Column** (`--doc_text_column`): Specify the input column containing document text to generate the hap_score against. Defaults to `contents`.\n",
    "- **Annotation Column** (`--annotation_column`): Specify the output column for HAP scores. Defaults to `hap_score`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps in This Notebook\n",
    "1. Define paths and import libraries.\n",
    "2. Convert CSV input to Parquet.\n",
    "3. Run the HAP transformation script.\n",
    "4. View and analyze the results.\n"
